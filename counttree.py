    Codefights.com interview practice question from Google by the same name.

    My first submission was to bisect a sorted list,
    which I new had O(n) insertion time complexity.
    After a search on the internet,
    I see how I could index in O(log n),
    I read nneoneo's algorithm outline to count in the binary tree.
